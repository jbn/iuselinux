User must restart TUI to see their sent message.\n\n## Expected Behavior\nAfter sending a message, it should appear immediately in the message list for the current chat.\n\n## Current Flow\n1. User types message and presses Enter\n2. `on_message_submitted` in HomeScreen sends via `app.api.send_message()`\n3. Server sends message via AppleScript, returns success\n4. WebSocket should receive the new message and push to TUI\n5. `on_new_messages` in HomeScreen should call `message_list.add_message()`\n\n## Investigation Areas\n1. **WebSocket connection**: Is WS actually connected? Check for \"Real-time updates connected\" notification\n2. **WebSocket receiving**: Is the server pushing messages? Add logging to `WebSocketClient.listen()`\n3. **Message routing**: Does `msg.chat_id == self._current_chat.rowid` match correctly?\n4. **Message parsing**: Is `_parse_message` correctly extracting `chat_id`?\n5. **UI update**: Is `add_message()` being called? Is it rendering correctly?\n\n## Debug Steps\n- Add logging throughout the message flow\n- Verify chat_id matching between sent message and current chat\n- Check if WebSocket receives ANY messages (not just sent ones)\n- Test receiving messages from another device to isolate send vs receive issue","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-06T14:04:17.151915-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-06T14:11:42.885744-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-06T14:11:42.885744-08:00"}
